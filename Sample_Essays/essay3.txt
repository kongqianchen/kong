Mid-autumn festival

Mid-autumn festival is one of the most important festivals for Chinese people.At that time, people will come back home and spend time with their families.

The meaning of this festival is to provide people a chance to get reunion.Chinese people pay special attention to the family reunion.

It is a good tradition, which is inherited for thousands of years.Mooncake is the classic food, which can represent this festival.

The most exciting moment for me is to appreciate the moon at the balcony and chat with my families.

We eat some snacks and talk so happily.Mid-autumn Festival is part of Chinese culture and should be reserved forever.
